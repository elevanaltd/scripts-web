# Phase 2.9 Fragmented Migrations - ARCHIVED

**Date Archived:** 2025-10-07
**Reason:** Migration conflict - consolidated into single atomic migration
**Status:** Successfully applied to production (optimizations active)

## Background

Phase 2.9 database hardening was initially implemented as 6 separate migrations:

1. `20251007000000_rls_initplan_optimization.sql` (251 lines)
2. `20251007010000_rls_policy_consolidation.sql` (238 lines)
3. `20251007020000_fix_ambiguous_column_reference.sql` (63 lines)
4. `20251007030000_fix_refresh_user_accessible_scripts_security.sql` (35 lines)
5. `20251007040000_fix_get_comment_descendants_column_name.sql` (43 lines)
6. `20251007999999_verify_all_security_hardening.sql` (31 lines)

**Problem Detected:** Migrations 1 and 2 had destructive conflicts:
- Migration 1 created policies with InitPlan optimization
- Migration 2 immediately dropped and recreated same policies (losing InitPlan patterns)

**Solution:** Consolidated into single comprehensive migration combining both optimizations.

## Production Status

All optimizations from these migrations ARE ACTIVE in production database:
- ✅ RLS InitPlan optimization (auth.uid() cached per query)
- ✅ Policy consolidation (50% fewer policy evaluations)
- ✅ Security hardening (search_path protection on SECURITY DEFINER functions)
- ✅ Bug fixes (column ambiguity, function corrections)

**Verified:** Supabase linter shows 0 errors, 0 warnings in production.

## Future Reference

For new deployments or database resets, use the unified migration:
`supabase/migrations/20251007000000_phase_2_9_database_hardening.sql`

This single migration contains all Phase 2.9 work without conflicts.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Single Migration Per Phase:** Database hardening should be one atomic migration
2. **Combined Optimizations:** RLS optimizations (InitPlan + Consolidation) belong together
3. **Test Before Production:** Migration conflicts should be caught in local testing
4. **Constitutional MIP:** Essential complexity (1 migration) vs accumulative (6 migrations)

**Holistic Orchestrator:** Gap ownership accepted for migration fragmentation.
**Constitutional Learning:** Future database optimization phases will use single comprehensive migrations.
