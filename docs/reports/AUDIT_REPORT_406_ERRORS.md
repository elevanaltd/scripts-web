# Supabase 406 Error Audit Report
**Date:** 2025-09-27
**Issue:** 406 errors despite data writing correctly
**Root Cause:** RLS policy misalignment with schema changes

## Executive Summary

The 406 "Not Acceptable" errors are caused by Row Level Security (RLS) policies that reference outdated schema structure. While data writes successfully using the service role key (which bypasses RLS), authenticated users encounter 406 errors because RLS policies deny access, causing Supabase to return an empty result set which triggers the 406 status.

## Key Findings

### 1. Schema Migration Incomplete
- **Issue:** Videos table migration from `project_id` to `eav_code` was only partially applied
- **Evidence:**
  - Migration file `20250927_migrate_to_eav_code.sql` exists
  - Fresh types show `eav_code` foreign key is present
  - But older RLS policies still reference `videos.project_id`

### 2. RLS Policy Conflicts
- **Issue:** Multiple overlapping and conflicting RLS policies
- **Evidence:**
  ```sql
  -- Old policy from 20250926040000_fix_client_select_policy.sql:
  WHERE p.id = videos.project_id  -- Line 56: Still uses old column

  -- New policy from 20250927_migrate_to_eav_code.sql:
  WHERE p.eav_code = videos.eav_code  -- Correct reference
  ```
- **Impact:** Policies fail silently, returning no rows, triggering 406

### 3. Role System Inconsistencies
- **Issue:** Different role checking methods across policies
- **Evidence:**
  - Some policies use: `(SELECT role FROM user_profiles WHERE id = auth.uid())`
  - Others use: `(auth.jwt() ->> 'role')`
  - Missing support for 'employee' role in many policies
- **Impact:** Employee users may have no access despite intended permissions

### 4. User Authentication Issues
- **Issue:** User creation trigger may not be setting roles correctly
- **Evidence:**
  - Test user creation fails with "Database error saving new user"
  - `handle_new_user()` trigger may have issues with role assignment
- **Impact:** New users may not get proper roles, causing access denial

## Data Integrity Status

### ✅ What's Working
1. **Service role operations** - All CRUD operations work with service key
2. **Data persistence** - Data is correctly saved to database
3. **Foreign keys** - `eav_code` relationship properly established
4. **RPC function** - `save_script_with_components` works correctly

### ❌ What's Broken
1. **Authenticated user access** - RLS policies block legitimate users
2. **Role-based access** - Employee role not properly supported
3. **Client filtering** - References to old `project_id` column
4. **User registration** - New user creation may fail

## Why 406 Instead of 403?

The 406 "Not Acceptable" status is misleading. Here's what happens:

1. User makes valid request with proper authentication
2. RLS policies evaluate and deny access (should be 403)
3. Query returns empty result set (not an error, just no rows)
4. Supabase RPC interprets "no rows returned" as "cannot produce acceptable response"
5. Returns 406 instead of more accurate 403 Forbidden

This is a known Supabase behavior when RLS blocks RPC functions that return sets.

## Impact Analysis

### Current Impact
- **Users affected:** All authenticated users (admin, employee, client)
- **Operations affected:** Script saves via RPC function
- **Data loss:** None - data saves correctly with service key
- **User experience:** Confusing errors despite successful operations

### Potential Risks
1. **Security:** Using service key in frontend bypasses all RLS
2. **Compliance:** Audit trail may be incomplete
3. **Scalability:** Cannot properly implement role-based features

## Remediation Plan

### Immediate Actions (Completed)
1. ✅ Created comprehensive reconciliation migration
2. ✅ Documented all policy conflicts
3. ✅ Created diagnostic scripts for testing

### Required Actions
1. **Apply migration:** Run `20250927_comprehensive_reconciliation.sql`
2. **Test with users:** Verify all role types can access appropriately
3. **Update frontend:** Ensure proper error handling for RLS denials
4. **Create test users:** Set up users with each role type

### Recommended Actions
1. **Add monitoring:** Log RLS denials for debugging
2. **Improve error messages:** Map 406 to user-friendly messages
3. **Document roles:** Create clear role permission matrix
4. **Regular audits:** Check for policy drift monthly

## Migration Safety

The provided migration (`20250927_comprehensive_reconciliation.sql`) is safe because:

1. **Idempotent:** Uses `IF EXISTS` and `IF NOT EXISTS` clauses
2. **Non-destructive:** Drops only policies, not data
3. **Comprehensive:** Addresses all identified issues
4. **Diagnostic:** Includes debug view for troubleshooting

## Testing Protocol

After applying migration:

```bash
# 1. Test with service role (should work)
node test-supabase-406.js

# 2. Create test users for each role
-- SQL to run in Supabase dashboard:
INSERT INTO auth.users (email, encrypted_password, email_confirmed_at, raw_user_meta_data)
VALUES
  ('admin@test.com', crypt('admin123', gen_salt('bf')), now(), '{"role": "admin"}'::jsonb),
  ('employee@test.com', crypt('employee123', gen_salt('bf')), now(), '{"role": "employee"}'::jsonb),
  ('client@test.com', crypt('client123', gen_salt('bf')), now(), '{"role": "client"}'::jsonb);

# 3. Test each role
node test-rls-406.js
```

## Prevention Measures

1. **Version control migrations:** Never apply changes via dashboard
2. **Test RLS locally:** Use Supabase CLI for local testing
3. **Automated testing:** Add RLS tests to CI/CD pipeline
4. **Documentation:** Maintain RLS policy documentation
5. **Code review:** Require approval for migration files

## Conclusion

The 406 errors are symptomatic of schema drift between migrations and actual database state. The root cause is RLS policies referencing outdated schema structure (`project_id` instead of `eav_code`). While data integrity is maintained, user experience is severely impacted.

The comprehensive reconciliation migration will resolve all identified issues by:
1. Ensuring schema consistency
2. Updating all RLS policies to use current schema
3. Supporting all intended user roles
4. Providing diagnostic tools for future issues

**Recommendation:** Apply the migration immediately to restore proper authenticated user access.
